# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App! This application demonstrates the concepts of asynchronous programming and DOM manipulation learned in Week 2 and Week 3.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetch current weather conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and cloud coverage.
- **Asynchronous API Calls**: Use async functions and promises to fetch and handle data from the OpenWeather API.
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Display weather data on the webpage using DOM manipulation techniques.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Implementation

This project focuses on:

- **Async & Promises**: Managing API requests and asynchronous operations.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the webpage with the fetched weather data.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a user-friendly interface across different devices and screen sizes.
