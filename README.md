# 100x-Devs-Journey

Welcome to my 100xDevs Cohort Assignments repository! This is where I’ll be showcasing all the projects and assignments that I’ll be working on during the cohort.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a dedicated space to document my progress and learning throughout the 100xDevs journey. Each folder within this repository is structured to keep track of every project and assignment I complete.

## Repository Layout

- **Projects/**: This directory contains the various projects I’ll be developing, each within its own folder for clarity.
- **Assignments/**: This section holds all the assignments given during the cohort, organized by week or topic.

## Goals

The primary aim of this repository is to:

1. Track my growth and progress during the cohort.
2. Provide a portfolio of my work for future reference.
3. Enhance my understanding of the concepts and technologies covered.

## How to Navigate

Feel free to explore the directories to see the work I’ve done. Each project and assignment will have its own README file with details about the task, the approach I took, and any challenges I faced.
